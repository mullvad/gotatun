# GotaTun

A userspace [WireGuard<sup>®</sup>](https://www.wireguard.com/) implementation, and a fork of [BoringTun](https://github.com/cloudflare/boringtun).

### Building

- Library only: `cargo build --lib --no-default-features --release [--target $(TARGET_TRIPLE)]`
- Executable: `cargo build --bin gotatun-cli --release [--target $(TARGET_TRIPLE)]`

#### Installation

By default the executable is placed in the `./target/release` folder. You can copy it to a desired location manually, or install it using `cargo install --bin gotatun-cli --path .`.

### Running

As per the specification, to start a tunnel use:

`gotatun-cli [-f/--foreground] INTERFACE-NAME`

The tunnel can then be configured using [wg](https://git.zx2c4.com/WireGuard/about/src/tools/man/wg.8), as a regular WireGuard tunnel, or any other tool.

It is also possible to use with [wg-quick](https://git.zx2c4.com/WireGuard/about/src/tools/man/wg-quick.8) by setting the environment variable `WG_QUICK_USERSPACE_IMPLEMENTATION` to `gotatun`. For example:

`sudo WG_QUICK_USERSPACE_IMPLEMENTATION=gotatun-cli WG_SUDO=1 wg-quick up CONFIGURATION`

### Testing

Testing this project has a few requirements:

- `sudo`: required to create tunnels. When you run `cargo test` you'll be prompted for your password.
- Docker: you can install it [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started). If you are on Ubuntu/Debian you can run `apt-get install docker.io`.

<sub>Other platforms may be added in the future</sub>

#### Linux

`x86-64`, `aarch64` and `armv7` architectures are supported. The behaviour should be identical to that of [wireguard-go](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-go/about/), with the following difference:

`gotatun` will drop privileges when started. When privileges are dropped it is not possible to set `fwmark`. If `fwmark` is required, such as when using `wg-quick`, run with `--disable-drop-privileges` or set the environment variable `WG_SUDO=1`.

You will need to give the executable the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability using: `sudo setcap cap_net_admin+epi gotatun`. sudo is not needed.

#### macOS

The behaviour is similar to that of [wireguard-go](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-go/about/). Specifically the interface name must be `utun[0-9]+` for an explicit interface name or `utun` to have the kernel select the lowest available. If you choose `utun` as the interface name, and the environment variable `WG_TUN_NAME_FILE` is defined, then the actual name of the interface chosen by the kernel is written to the file specified by that variable.
